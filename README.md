Takes a phylogeny and a taxonomy and labels nodes representing higher-order 
taxa in the phylogeny.

Both the phylogeny and the taxonomy should be trees in a format supported by
BioPython.

For help on usage, run `python phylolabel.py -h`

Note: this currently relies on functionality in my development fork of BioPython 
which hasn't been pulled into the main branch yet. You can get my fork here:
